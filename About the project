1. The Problem: Why Churn Matters

In the banking sector, retaining a customer is significantly cheaper than acquiring a new one. This project analyzes a dataset of 10,000 customers to identify the "red flags" that signal a customer is about to leave (churn).

3. Key Insights from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

My visualizations revealed several critical patterns:
•	The Age Factor: Older customers show a higher tendency to churn. This might suggest that the bank's digital products or loyalty rewards are better suited for younger demographics.
•	Geography Matters: Germany has a significantly higher churn rate compared to France and Spain. This is a huge finding—it suggests a need for a deep dive into regional competition or service quality in Germany.
•	Product Overload: Interestingly, customers with 3 or 4 products have extremely high churn. This often indicates "forced" cross-selling where customers feel overwhelmed or dissatisfied with the bundled services.
•	Activity Gap: As expected, inactive members are much more likely to leave.
 
5. The Modeling Approach

I tested two primary models to predict the probability of a customer exiting:
1.	Logistic Regression: A great baseline, achieving an AUC of 0.777.
2.	Random Forest: Our top performer with an AUC of 0.855.

The Random Forest model is superior here because it captures the non-linear relationships in the data (like the complex interaction between the number of products and churn).

4. Strategic Recommendations

Based on the data, here is how the bank can reduce churn:
•	Targeted Engagement for Inactive Members: Launch re-activation campaigns (e.g., special interest rates or personalized offers) specifically for those flagged as "Inactive."
•	Review German Operations: Investigate why German customers are unhappy. Is it higher fees? Local competitors? A localized survey is needed.
•	Simplify the Product Suite: Since churn spikes at 3+ products, the bank should review its multi-product bundles to ensure they add genuine value rather than complexity.
•	Proactive Retention for Older Clients: Develop wealth management or retirement-focused features to better engage the older demographic which is currently at risk.
