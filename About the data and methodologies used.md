DATASET – INDEPENDENT AND DEPENDENT VARIABLES

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and contains 10,000 samples with 13 independent feature variables and one dependent (target) variable. All variables were used during model training and prediction.

The independent variables include customer demographic, financial, and account-related information such as Credit Score, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Account Balance, Number of Products, Credit Card ownership, Active Membership status, and Estimated Salary, along with customer identifiers.

The dependent variable is Exited, which is a binary categorical variable indicating customer churn, where 0 represents customers who remained with the bank and 1 represents customers who exited.

There are no missing values in the dataset. The target variable is imbalanced, which informed the modeling and evaluation strategy.

What Drives Customer Churn and How Can It Be Reduced?
